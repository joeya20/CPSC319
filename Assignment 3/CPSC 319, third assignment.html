     Third assignment</h1>

<h3>The problem: a very customized ternary tree</h3>
<p>
The task your system has to perform is to implement a ternary tree with
strings as payload and a set of operations on the tree so that the
system can read in a sequence of these operations from the input
file and outputs the results from those operations that produce 
certain outputs (in addition to often manipulating the tree).
</p>
<p>
The strings can consist of all printable characters excluding the blank 
(although the occurence of
a particular character at the beginning of a string can change the operation 
that the string occurs in as argument, see below).
</p>
<p>
When the system starts, it has to create an initial tree consisting just of 
the root with the string<br>
root<br>
as payload.
</p>
<p>
In the following, a and b are variables that represent valid strings.
</p>
<p>
There are 3 operations that add nodes to the tree:
</p><ul>
<li>AddL(a,b)
</li><li>AddM(a,b)
</li><li>AddR(a,b)
</li></ul>
They add a node with payload b to the node with payload a in the tree 
as left child, middle child, right child, respectively. If there is no node
with payload a in the tree, these operations have no effect. If there are
more than one node with payload a in the tree, the operations are applied
to the node with payload a that has the highest level (numerically) and if 
there are more than one of those nodes to the one the most right in the tree. 
If the
correct node with payload a already has a child node at the indicated
position, the operation does not change the tree, but writes<br>
Add operation not possible. <br>
to the output file and continues on to the next operation in the input file.
<p></p>
<p>
If there are more than one comma in the concatenation of a,b, then the comma
intended as the comma separating the arguments a and b is the first comma,
except if this comma is followed by other commas. If it is followed by
other commas, then the last of this sequence of commas is the comma
seperating the two arguments (and all commas before it belong to the
first argument).
</p>
<p>
There are 3 operations that delete nodes from the tree:
</p><ul>
<li>DelL(a) 
</li><li>DelM(a)
</li><li>DelR(a)
</li></ul>
Each operation deletes the whole subtree at the indicated position (left,
middle, right) of the node with payload a. If there is no node
with payload a in the tree, these operations have no effect. If there are more
than one node with payload a in the tree, the operations are applied
to the node with payload a that has the highest level (numerically) and if there are
more than one of those nodes to the one the most left in the tree. If the
correct node with payload a has no child at the indicated
position, the operation does not change the tree and the system continues 
on to the next operation in the input file.
<p></p>
<p>
There is one operation that changes the payload of nodes in the tree:
</p><ul>
<li>Exchange(a,b)
</li></ul>
This operation changes the payload of all nodes in the tree that currently
have payload a to the new payload b. If there are no nodes with payload a
no changes to the tree happen.
<p></p>
<p>
If there are more than one comma in the concatenation of a,b, then the comma
intended as the comma separating the arguments a and b is the first comma,
except if this comma is followed by other commas. If it is followed by
other commas, then the last of this sequence of commas is the comma
seperating the two arguments (and all commas before it belong to the
first argument).
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is the operation
</p><ul>
<li>Print()
</li></ul>
which prints the current tree in the following manner:<br>
the payloads of the nodes in the tree should be outputted level by level,
starting with the root level, one level per line in the output. The sequence 
the payloads of the nodes in a level should be outputted is from left to 
right (and, obviously, left child, then middle child and then right child),
printing each string seperated by a blank, followed by a semicolon followed
by a blank. The last payload element of a level should not be followed by
anything. If a node does not have nodes in the positions of all of
its children, then these "missing" children do not produce any output 
(and there should be no seperation strings for non-existing nodes) when their 
level is outputted (and this recursively applies to all deeper levels).
<p></p>
<p>
The main customization aspect of the ternary tree is around using one
specific character, namely<br>
$<br>
to modify some of the operations above. If the string b starts with a $,
all Add operations overwrite the payload of the appropriate child node of the
node identified via the a argument by the string following the $, if
such a node exists. Otherwise, the operations should proceed as described
above (using as b the initial b without the $; an additional $ does not
create any changes and is also not eliminated). 
</p>
<p>
The Exchange
operation does not replace the string a by b for all applicable nodes, 
instead it appends
the string after the $ given by b to the already existing payload a.
</p>

<h3>Input file</h3>
<p>
In an input file, there is a sequence of the commands defined above, each
command in its own line. Your system has to perform each command as
described, including generating the described output.
</p>
<h3>Output file</h3>
<p>
In the output file, you write the outputs described above for each
command in the input file in the order as given by the input file (each
starting in a new line, if output is required).
If during reading of the input file, your system encounters an input that
is not a valid command as defined above (or below), your system has to
output:<br>
Input error.<br>
and terminate.
</p>
<h3>General requirements</h3>
<p>
Regarding blanks and empty lines, the same requirements as in assignment
1 and 2 have to be fulfilled (if not stated otherwise above).
